# Trust the Crowd

A psychology experiment that explores social conformity and decision-making under peer pressure.

## About

After taking AP Psychology, I got fascinated by how people's decisions change when they see what others are doing. This project combines my computer science skills with psychology concepts I learned about conformity, social influence, and group behavior.

The app presents moral dilemmas and ethical questions, then shows fake "crowd statistics" to see if users change their answers after seeing what the majority supposedly chose.

## What It Does

- Presents 7 ethical/moral questions with two choices each
- Records your initial answer
- Shows fake crowd statistics (randomly generated percentages)
- Gives you 10 seconds to either stick with your answer or change it
- Tracks whether you conformed to the majority opinion
- Provides a summary of your conformity patterns

## The Psychology Behind It

This is inspired by Solomon Asch's conformity experiments and other social psychology research about how peer pressure influences our decisions. The app measures:

- How often you change your mind after seeing crowd data
- Whether you tend to agree with the majority
- Your overall susceptibility to social information
